Tag:  #daily #nodejs #expressjs #API 

with express js I can build  api easily with some kind of routes

Just need to configure in the first step my package.json a a "module"

with nodemon you can watch in real time when something change

```json
"start:dev": "nodemon ./src/index.mjs",
"start": "node ./src/index.mjs"
```
for example I can use these scripts


after I juste need to configure the entries points with the informations I want to work with

this is the first route of my API with the first paramether "/" and the callback function with 2 args, here only the second one work with the reponse in json format
```js
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send({
	    message: `Welcome to our API.`,
	  });
});
...
```

It possible to make calls with some parameters on the endpoints

```js
app.get("/api/users/age/:age", (request, response) => {
		const age = parseInt(request.params.age);
		const usersWithSameAge = users.filter((user) => user.age === age);
	response.send(usersWithSameAge);
});
```

it's possible too  to make query instead with request.query
