| HTTP Method | Purpose                                  | Idempotent | Use Case | Example |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|------------|----------|---------|
| GET         | Retrieve data from the server.           | Yes        | Fetching a user profile, a webpage, or an image. | `GET /user/123` retrieves user data. |
| POST        | Submit data to the server.               | No         | Creating a new record, such as a new user or a blog post. | `POST /user` with user data creates a new user. |
| PUT         | Update a resource completely.            | Yes        | Updating an existing resource with a full new version. | `PUT /user/123` with the complete updated user data. |
| PATCH       | Partially update a resource.             | No*        | Making partial changes to a resource, like updating just the email of a user. | `PATCH /user/123` with only the email field to update it. |
| DELETE      | Delete a resource.                       | Yes        | Removing a resource from the server. | `DELETE /user/123` removes the user. |
| HEAD        | Retrieve headers without a response body.| Yes        | Checking what a GET request will return before making the request, like meta-information. | `HEAD /user/123` retrieves headers for the user data. |
| OPTIONS     | Describe communication options.          | Yes        | Discovering allowed methods on a server or for CORS preflight requests. | `OPTIONS /user/123` returns the allowed HTTP methods. |

*PATCH can be idempotent, but it depends on how it's implemented on the server.
**Explanation:**

- **GET:** Safe and idempotent. Ideal for retrieving data without any side effects.
- **POST:** Non-idempotent. Best for creating new resources where the server controls the new resource URL.
- **PUT:** Idempotent. Suited for updating or replacing a resource entirely.
- **PATCH:** Not necessarily idempotent. Used for partial updates to a resource.
- **DELETE:** Idempotent. Used to remove resources.
- **HEAD:** Like GET but only retrieves the headers. Useful for meta-information.
- **OPTIONS:** Provides information about communication options, often used in CORS scenarios.
